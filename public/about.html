<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Fuzail, and I’m a budding web developer with a strong passion for technology and creativity. From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, and that curiosity naturally led me to the world of coding. I’m currently diving deep into web development, learning the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every line of code I write is a step toward mastering the craft, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>

  <p>My approach to web development is driven by a desire to create user-friendly, visually appealing websites that provide a seamless experience. I believe that a website is more than just a collection of pages; it’s a platform for communication, expression, and connection. I’m committed to developing websites that not only look good but also serve a purpose and meet the needs of users. Through each project, I challenge myself to think critically and solve problems creatively.</p>

  <p>This portfolio is a showcase of my work and growth as a developer. It features the projects I’ve built, the skills I’ve acquired, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way. As I continue to evolve in this field, I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you’re interested in working together or just want to connect, feel free to reach out. Let’s build something great together!</p>
